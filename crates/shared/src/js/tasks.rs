// add task to wait loop, initally, we will only watch this task, not the child processes

// launch the tunnel process, return task handle
// on python, we did: 
//   fs = forward(remote=(sp['tunHost'], int(sp['tunPort'])), ticket=sp['ticket'], timeout=sp['tunWait'], check_certificate=sp['tunChk'])  # type: ignore
// fs maybe a json object that can be used from js to check status, get info, etc.. (basically, we need to know the port and if the tunnel started ok)

// add file to deleter, before the wait loop starts

// add file to deleter, after the wait loop starts
