Note:
In order to run the appimage-builder, you need to have a version of app-image greater than 1.1.0, 
At current date (2024, march) the latest version is 1.1.0, so you need to install it from the source code.
This is needed to build correctly the arm64 appimage. If you don't need to build the arm64 appimage, you can install the appimage-builder from pip.

pip install git+https://github.com/AppImageCrafters/appimage-builder.git
